# Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)

## Overview

Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is a technique for visualizing and interpreting the decisions made by deep learning models, particularly in the context of image classification. It highlights the regions of an input image that contribute the most to a particular prediction, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

## How Grad-CAM Works

- **Backpropagation:** During the forward pass, the model's output is computed for a given input image.
  
- **Class-Specific Gradients:** The gradients of the predicted class score with respect to the feature maps of the final convolutional layer are computed. This highlights which regions of the feature maps contribute most to the predicted class.

- **Pooling:** The gradients are spatially pooled (averaged) to obtain a coarse localization of important regions.

- **Weighted Sum:** Each feature map is weighted by its corresponding gradient, emphasizing the importance of different channels.

- **Activation Map:** The weighted sum is used to create a class activation map, highlighting regions in the input image that are influential for the predicted class.

## Usage

Grad-CAM is often applied to pre-trained deep learning models for image classification. Here's a general outline of the process:

1. **Load Pre-trained Model:** Use a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification. Common choices include models trained on ImageNet, such as ResNet, VGG, or Inception.

2. **Prepare Input Image:** Preprocess the input image according to the requirements of the chosen model.

3. **Apply Grad-CAM:** Use the Grad-CAM algorithm to generate a heatmap highlighting important regions of the input image.

4. **Visualize Results:** Overlay the heatmap onto the input image to visualize which parts of the image are influential for the model's prediction.
